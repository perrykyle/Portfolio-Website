# Portfolio-Website

 Slowly developing my portfolio website using raw html css and js.

I want to improve my UI skills and this project is to display my information as well as work on my portfolio

Each version I test new things and take what I like into the next version. Documenting in Github

### Currently Developing PortfolioV5
